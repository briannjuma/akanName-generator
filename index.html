          Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana and
          most parts of West Africa, children are given their first name as a
          result of 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they
          were born. To get your corresponding Akan name this web application
          provides you with a table as well as an automated form. Enjoy!!!
