## Project Description
I built a web application that captures a user's birth date and from that data calculates the day of the week they were born i.e( Monday, Teusday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday) and then with combination of the user's gender it outputs their Akan name alternative. 
<br>
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
<br>
MALE: Sunday: Kwasi| Monday: Kwadwo| Teusday: Kwabena| Wednesday: Kwaku| Thursday: Yaw| Friday: Kofi| Saturday: Kwame.
<br>
FEMALE: Sunday: Akosua| Monday: Adwoa| Teusday: Abenaa| Wednesday: Akua| Thursday: Yaa| Friday: Afua| Saturday: Ama.
